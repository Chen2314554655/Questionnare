# 1.Procedure specification 
In order to further reduce the cost of studying the questionnaire, the user should be reminded of the English letters represented by each option before the program runs

After the questionnaire starts, you can only enter the English letters represented by each option. If you enter a wrong letter, the system will not run and prompt the user to enter again

When the game is over, the system will notify the user of the choice of the system. If the technology allows, compare the current user's choice with the total data in the database, so that the user can learn more about the ideas of different people.

# 3.Business Process model
Our team wants to create a questionnaire that can be used on a computer. 

We will work with developers to produce software for several weeks, provide documentation, and sign necessary contracts.

If the software is suitable for both clients and developers, we will eventually release it.
